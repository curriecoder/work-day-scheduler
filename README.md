# work-day-scheduler

## Description

This project was motivated by a desire to illustrate moment.js, javascript interactive elements, and dynamic HTML content with CSS manipulation. This project allows users to view the current date and setup events by hour.

## Usage

Instructions: Fill out the text fields for the corresponding hour block and click the save button on the right of the schedule. As the day progresses, the time blocks will change color to indicate if it is in the past, present, or future hour.

## Credits

I would first like to thank the instructors of UPenn LPS Coding Bootcamp class of 08-2021 for continually putting the students at the top of the importance list. Also, thanks to all of my classmates that helped me rubber duck my way through this project.
